Notes from thejourneydude:

- sketching is the core of everything. sketching is the fastest form of designing.
- any design skills as diverse as they are will be a huge benefit
- photography knowledge will help you. here some key terms you will face with VR
    - field of view: the extent of the observable world that is seen at any given moment.
    - depth of field: the amount of distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in acceptably sharp focus in the user’s view
    - caustics :the envelope of light rays reflected or refracted by a curved surface or object, or the projection of that envelope of rays on another surface. think of light reflected off a glass of water.
    - exposure: the amount of light per unit area (the image plane illuminance times the exposure time) reaching aphotographic film or electronic image sensor, as determined by shutter speed, lens aperture and scene luminance.
- being able to use light to your advantage will be valuable
- the more you know 3d and tools, the less you will have to learn. skills you will need to know is architecture, character, props modeling, rigging, uv mapping, texturing, dynamics, particles, and so on.
- Motion design is important. As designers, we know how to work with devices with physical boundaries. VR has none, so it’s a different way of thinking. “How does this element appear and disappear?” will be a redundant question.
- Python, C#, C++ or any previous coding skills will help you ramp up faster. Prototyping has a big place because of the fundamental need of iterating. This area is so new that you might be one of the first to design a unique kind of interaction. Any recent game engine such as Unity or Unreal engine largely integrates code. There is a large active community in game and VR development with a huge amount of training and resources already.
- Be prepared to be scared and get ready to embrace the unknown. It’s a new world that evolves every day. Even the biggest industry-leading companies are still trying to figure things out. That’s how it is.
- roles:
    - there are two big design buckets
        - core user experience, interface, and interaction design. This is very close to how product design team are structured today (Visual, UI, UX, motion designers, researchers, and prototypers). The goal will always remain the same; create a fast iteration cycle to explore a wide range of interactive designs.
- fundamentals of vr design:
- two rules to follow by:
    - maintain head tracking
    - do not drop frames
- terms to know:
    - physiological comfort: It regroups notions like motion sickness. Be careful when using acceleration and deceleration. Maintain a stable horizon line to avoid the “sea sickness” effect.
    - environment comfort: People can experience various discomforts in certain situation like heights, small spaces (claustrophobia), big spaces (agoraphobia) and so on. Be careful with the scale and colliding objects. For example, if someone throws an object at you, you will instinctively try to grab it, dodge or protect yourself. Use it to your advantage and not to user’s disadvantage.
- you can use user senses to help you create more immersive products and cues. find inspiration from the gaming industry. for example:
        - audio fo spatial positioning
        - light to show a path and help a player
- Do not hurt or over-fatigue your users. sci-fi movies may look cool, but they are go against simple ergonomic rules
- XY head movement safe zone https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1600/1*XJwTciYJOXlJMu62D1vDNw.jpeg
- Avoid extended look down interactions. https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/1600/1*TxrR4g5d6HZVhBN0nyRwcA.jpeg
- degrees of freedom reference how a device measures users movement. there are two types of degrees of freedom.
    - 3 degrees of freedom (orientation tracking). found in google cardboard. measures rotational tracking.
    - 6 degrees of freedom (orientation + position tracking. found in vive and rift. it measures both position and rotation. Making 6DOF possible frequently involves optical tracking of infrared emitters by one or more sensors.
- input technology is constantly evolving. inputs are the keystone that will drive some decisions differently depending on which method you are using. You should be familiar with all of them and aware of their limitations.
- tools:
    - pen and paper. the cost of moving fro wireframes to hi-fi is higher than 2d
    - sketch: program used for prototyping.
    - cinema 4d:  When you don’t have a 3D background, the learning curve can be very steep.
    - unity: It’s most certainly THE prototyping tool where everything will happen. You can easily create and move things around with a direct VR preview of your project.
    - unreal engine: One of the big advantages over the competition are the graphic capabilities; Unreal is one step ahead in nearly every area: terrain, particles, post processing effects, shadows & lighting, and shaders. Everything looks amazing.
- Understand, identify, build and iterate. Over and over.
