#### Notes from thejourneydude:


- Think like a human
  - This approach (being a change from users seeing the savannah to one of looking at a screen) allows for a high level of information density and multitasking. The down-side is that new interaction models need to be learned and there is a higher cognitive load to decision making.
  - I suspect that the older, instinctual danger or reward cues (sensory) are easier for us to pick up on.
  - For example, if you’re in a VR landscape and there is a pit on one side of you and a flat road on the other, you will take the road — even though there is no real danger. Now let’s say there is a sign for a pit and a sign for a road. It takes time to read and comprehend the sign (cognitive load) and as we know people don’t tend to read much, so about half will head towards the pit and the rest will take the road.
  - It seems that the author is making a point that because we are now in our own virtual world, we can create our own savannah, without having to use signs. Another way of thinking about it, if you want an user to avoid entering a room, place a hungry tiger inside it.

- Use perspective to your advantage:
  - size is based on the distance between the user and a piece of content.
  - content can be treated a couple of ways.
    - as a heads-up display, locking it to a set distance from the viewer.
    - it can be locked to the environment, so the user’s view of the content changes as they move through the environment.
    - it can float free, locked to the world.
- Look around
    -  we are designed so that we have a focus point of view when looking at something, and then to the side its a peripheral point of view. This is termed as the Cone Of Focus.
    - ways to solve the cone-of focus: from worst to best
        - flat: common solution: The interface is skinned for the 3D space. It’s difficult to read text or images in perspective. There is no sense of grounding in the space. It’s a wall.
        - Curved: Marginally better: The content is curved around the user, so the tiles always face the user — making it much easier to read text or images.
        - Less Content: Less content is better, even if that requires some way to move through it.
        - Surrounded: Best: hierarchy can be implied by nearness to the cone of focus. secondary content can be pushed out of immediate view but still remain accessible

- build to scale
    - Affordance is a common term in user experience design that means: A situation where an object’s sensory characteristics intuitively imply its functionality and use
    - Another term for affordance: a situation where an object’s sensory characteristics intuitively imply its functionality and use. A button, by being slightly raised above an otherwise flat surface, suggests the idea of pushing it. A lever, by being an appropriate size for grasping, suggests pulling it. A blinking red light and buzzer suggests a problem and demands attention. A chair, by its size, its curvature, its balance, and its position, suggests sitting on it.
    - VR will need affordances to indicate what can be interacted with, and when that interaction takes place. The sensory display of those affordances should scale with technology just like screen affordances. A highlight that now occurs on gaze, should still work for hand tracking, micro-gestures or a mind event.
    - VR will need affordances to indicate to the user what can be interacted with and when it takes place. The sensory display of those affordances should scale with the technology as it advances. For example, if I have a tiger roar to the left side of the user, they should hear that tiger to their left side no matter what tech they are using.



- focus on the experience
    - avoid rapid movement, makes people sick
    - if there is a horizon line, keep it steady. rolling horizons make people sick.
    - avoid rapid or abrupt transitions to the world space, it becomes very disorientating
    - don’t require the user to move their head or body too much. its disorientating and they may be in a position where they can’t move
    - be careful about mixing 2d GUI and 3d, the change can be jarring
    - keep the density of info and objects on the screen low, much lower than in standard screen design. not everything has to be in view.
    - use real-world cues when appropriate. For example: want to attract someones attention, take an auditory or visual cue to get the user to commit a certain action.
    - bright scenes are fatiguing
    - when it doubt: test, test, test
